# GPU-Performance-ANN

Welcome to the **GPU-Performance-ANN** repository! This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict the performance of GPUs based on various parameters. The dataset contains performance metrics of GPUs, and the ANN model is trained to analyze and predict their performance.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

The aim of this project is to predict GPU performance using a neural network model. By leveraging the power of machine learning and GPU data, this project showcases how ANN can be applied to hardware performance analysis, helping in optimizing resources and making informed decisions.

### **Repository Structure**
- **`README.md`**: This file you're reading.
- **`gpu_ann.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that contains the implementation of the ANN model for predicting GPU performance.
- **`sgemm_product.csv`**: A dataset used for training the ANN model, containing GPU-related performance metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadmadnouman911/GPU-Performance-ANN.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
